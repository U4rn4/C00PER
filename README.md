<h1>C00PER BOT</h1>

<p>C00per is a programming project with the aim of giving a pre-made base to people who want to start making a discord bot using the discord.py library. </p>

<p>It uses different cogs for each different command section and these have their respective libraries and apis that have to be installed, not counting discordpy. </p>
<p>Here are the cogs and their complements:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Generic:</b> Utility commands. Random lib is imported</li>
  <li><b>Mod: </b> Moderation commands. </li>
  <li><b>Music: </b> Full music cog with all the usual discord music bot functionalities. The yt_dlp lib is imported and the asyncio one too</li>
  <li><b>Translate:</b> This cog implements a command that can translate from diferents languages in discord using the deepl API. The deepl Api is used as well as its libray deepl</li>
</ul>
<p>Is important to create a new module under the name of apikeys to write there the token of the bot and also the api tokens </p>
<p>To start the bot you must have python installed along with the respective external libraries, then run main.py</p>
